      #Getting Set Up

      **[Atom](https://atom.io/)** - a text editor with colour highlighting and other useful features. 
      
      If you are unable to install Atom, try installing: <!-- .element: class="note" -->[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) (Mac or Windows) or [Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html) (older Macs).

      **[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/)** - Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and has good development tools. 

      To set Chrome as your default browser, follow<!-- .element: class="note" --> [these instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?hl=en). 

      Firefox, Safari, and IE 10+ are great, but their dev tools are slightly different so stick to Chrome for this class please!

      #Chrome Developer Tools

      **Developer tools** allow us to *inspect* any web page and also includes a *mobile device emulator*. Access the tool in 2 ways:

      * right-click / two-finger tap on a web page and select **Inspect Element** 
      * keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl + Shift + I** (PC) / **Cmnd + Option + I** (Mac)
      
      Once open, click on the the phone icon to start the emulator. It changes to blue when it's on, and click it again to turn it off.

        #Different types of web design

        Flexible websites are not new concepts so in order to understand responsive web design and development better, we have to understand what the options are:

        *   Fixed
        *   Fluid
        *   Adaptive
        *   Responsive

      #Fixed Web Design

      *   Everything has a set width (eg. 960px). 
      *   Popular method before mobile browsing became commonplace.
      *   On a mobile screen, it is zoomed out to the size of the device making the content really small. 
      *   Needs a separate site, usually an "m dot" site, to make something mobile friendly :(

      > Try opening these sites on your phone or resize the browser. What are the differences?

        #Fluid web design
        
        *   Based on percentage widths, each block of content takes up a percentage of the page. (e.g. a sidebar with a width of 30% and main section with a width of ~70%)
        *   When you resize the browser, the blocks will resize *relative* to the size of the page (aka the "viewport").
        *   Not optimized for smaller screens & mobile devices.

      *   Best to think of it as a _set_ of fixed layouts that are invoked in response to the device size.

      #One more concept: mobile-first design

      We used to design with only a desktop in mind, but this has changed with smartphones and tablets, giving rise to "mobile first design."

      What is it?

      *   Design an experience for mobile devices first, then desktop
      *   Make mobile integral, not an afterthought
      *   "Graceful Degradation" and "Progressive Enhancement"

        #HTML (HyperText Markup Language) Overview
        
        * HTML is the language browsers read 
        * used to wrap content and text to assign meaning to the web document
        * use **tags** to create HTML **elements**
        * HTML5 is the latest version

        ```xml
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        ```

        Almost all elements have an "opening" tag and a "closing" tag. The closing tag has a forward slash (`/`). Remember to close tags in reverse order. 

        Example:

        ```xml
        <p>Paragraph with a <a href="#">link</a>.</p>
        ```

        # HTML Elements

        We'd be here all day if we had to go over every single HTML & HTML5 element - there are so many! So here's a [handy list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list) for reference.

        Let's go over some commonly used tags.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #HTML: Common tags

        **Title**: Found in the `<head>` section of the HTML document. Defines the page title. Displays in the browser's tab, search engine results and bookmarks.

        ```xml
        <title>Page Title</title>
        ```

        **Headings**: There are 6 heading tags (`<h1>,<h2>,...,<h6>`) and follow a hierarchical structure. It's important to use the appropriate tag to describe the content, not for the default heading styles. That's what CSS is for!

        ```xml
        <h1>Most Important Heading</h1>
        <h2>Second Most Important Heading</h2>
        ```

        **Paragraphs**: Created with the `<p></p>` tags.
        ```xml
        <p>I'm a paragraph.</p>
        ```
        **Lists**: There are two kinds of lists: ordered (`ol`) for numbered lists & undordered (`ul`) for lists with bullets. Content must be included only within the list item (`li`).

        ```xml
        <ul>
            <li>Unordered list item</li>
            <li>Unordered list item</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Ordered list item</li>

        #HTML: Tags with Attributes

        Attributes are used to provide more information about the HTML element. Let's look at a few common ones.
        
        Links use the `<a>` tag and an `href` *attribute* to specify where to link to.

        ```
        <a href="http://website.com">link</a>
        ```

        Images use an `<img>` tag and the `src` attribute, to link to the image file and and `alt` for accessiblity. Also note that the image tag has no closing tag.
        ```
        <img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="alternative text">
        ```
      </script>

      <script type="text/template">
        #More Attributes

        Here are two more attributes, mostly used for CSS styling.

        **class** - can be used multiple times per page
        
        ```xml
        <div class="column">Class example</div>
        ```
        
        **id** - can be used for CSS styling, in-page links and only once per page
        
        ```xml
        <div id="about">About section</div>
        ```

      #HTML Element Relationships

      Elements have relationships with other elements in the HTML document that follow a family tree-like structure with branches of descendants, siblings, parents and children.

        Nested HTML tags are indented, to increase readability of the code.

        ```xml

      #CSS Overview

      CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is used to style the HTML elements.

      A CSS document is made up of a bunch "rules", that reference the HTML elements in the HTML document. These rules include a **selector** and one or more **declarations**. 
      
      Each declaration has a **property** and a **value**.

      ```css
      selector {
        property: value;
      }
      ```

      The **selector** specifies which element(s) to apply the styling to. The **declaration** contains what styles to apply. 

      ```css
      h1 {
        color: red;
      }
      ```

          border: 3px solid #333;
          background-color: lightblue;
        }
        ```

        * property & values are separated by a _colon_
        * each declaration ends in a _semi-colon_
        * write each declaration on its own line to make it easier to read
        * there are MANY CSS properties

        #Writing CSS - Where Does it Go?

        CSS can be added a few ways but today we'll use the recommended method, an external stylesheet. The CSS will be contained in it's own file, separate from the HTML.

        CSS files are referenced in the `<head>` element with a `<link>` tag and two **attributes**, `rel` and `href`. The `href` value points to the location of the style sheet file.

        #Type & Descendant Selectors

        Type selectors select HTML elements by using the tag name.

        ```css
        p {
          /* styles for all paragraphs on the page*/
        }
        a {
          /* styles for all links on the page*/  
        }
        ```

        Descendant selectors target any child/descendant elements.  Note the space *in between* the element names.

        ```css
        section p {
          /* all paragraphs that are descendants of any section tag */
        }

        ul li a {
          /* links inside of list items, inside of unordered lists. */

      #Class attribute & selector

      Classes are used mostly for CSS styles and can be used one or more times on the same page.  The value of the class is named by you!
      
      To use it, add it in the *opening* HTML tag. You can have more than one class for the same element.

      ```xml
      <div class="button"></div>
      <div class="button warning"></div>

      ```

      In the CSS, a class selector starts with a leading period.

      ```
      .button {
        background-color: lightblue;
      }

## CSS Selectors

Let's go back to **styles.css** and try to find each type of selector and combinations we've just learned about:

*   Type Selectors
*   Descendant Selectors
*   Class Selectors
*   Combined Selectors

>Let's look at the **index.html** and **styles.css** files for examples.
    </script></section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Inheritance

In the **styles.css** file, the body selector contains a `font-family` property. 

```css
body {
  font-family: "Merriweather", serif;
  ...
}
```
Why is it declared here?

Remember, CSS stands for *Cascading* Style Sheets. The browser reads the CSS from *top to bottom* (or cascades) and some of these styles are inherited from their parent elements. This makes it more efficient than declaring this same styles over and over again for each element.
    </script></section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
##Specificity

What's going on here? Why are there so many `h2`'s?

```css
h2, h3, h4 {
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  margin: 0;
}
h2, h3 {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 32px;

section h2 {

##Specificity cont.
The most specific selector OR the most recent CSS rule will be selected and rendered into the browser. Which one gets selected is based largely on magic.

GENERAL RULE: the styles for an element that came last in the CSS document will be used, *unless* overridden by a more *specific* selector. Classes, for example, are more specific than a type selector.

```css
p {
/* all paragraphs - less specific */
}

p.special-paragraph {
/* only paragraphs with this class - more specific */
}

##Percentages and CSS3 Media Queries

A fluid layout using percentages + media queries = responsive design

Let's see what happens when the CSS is not fluid. Larger resolution looks great:

![](http://cl.ly/image/0G3l1q3E0n2M/Image%202015-01-29%20at%2011.55.08%20PM.png)

Smaller resolutions, not so good:

![](http://cl.ly/image/3c2y1v2A2o1q/Image%202015-01-29%20at%2011.55.36%20PM.png)

On the phone, it's even worse! (Screen shot from Chrome's emulator dev tool - more on this later.)

![](http://cl.ly/image/1u0r0i0z0w1L/Image%202015-01-30%20at%2012.03.46%20AM.png)
    </script></section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
##Percentages first, then media queries

In **styles.css**, look for this code block.  It should be around line 79.  Notice that the width is set to a fixed width of 1000px.  

```css
.content-wrap {
  width: 1000px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 90px 0; 
}
```

That means no matter what, that container will always be 1000px.  

Let's change it to `max-width: 1000px;` and also add `width: 80%;` and see how that changes the page.

**Pro tip!** In Sublime, select **Find > Find...**  OR Control/Command F -- this will open a bar at the bottom of the screen.  Type in **.content-wrap** and select Find.  This will make it easier to search for code snippets.
    </script></section>

    <section class="slide side-by-side" data-markdown>
##Fluid is not the same as responsive

It works much better now, the content is scaled relative to the size of the browser.

![](http://cl.ly/image/3c2y1v2A2o1q/Image%202015-01-29%20at%2011.55.36%20PM.png)
![](http://cl.ly/image/3Z3U023P361J/Image%202015-01-30%20at%2012.37.27%20AM.png)

But sometimes, when you get to a smaller size, you might want to make changes that go beyond just scaling up/down the width of the page components. 
    </script></section>

    <section class="slide side-by-side" data-markdown>
##What if we did something like this?

This is an example of a responsive change. The CSS has *changed* based on a screen size. 

![](http://cl.ly/image/3Z3U023P361J/Image%202015-01-30%20at%2012.37.27%20AM.png)
![](http://cl.ly/image/03403z392120/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-30%20at%2012.33.31%20AM.png)
    </script></section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
##Media Queries

Media queries are the key to making a responsive website because it allows you to apply CSS to your document *only* when the screen has reach a certain size. Lets take a look at a basic media query.

```css
@media (max-width: 940px) {
  body {
    background: red;
  }
}
```
In the above we target all [media types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media) and the max-width of 940px. Anything *equal* or *less than* 940px wide will apply this CSS.

Notice how the CSS is nested inside of what looks like another CSS rule? You can have multiple CSS declaration blocks in one media query.

```css
@media (max-width: 940px) {
  body {
    background: red;
  }
  h2 {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
}
```

The above CSS gets applied when the browser reaches a width of 940px or smaller. This is referred to as a **breakpoint**.
    </script></section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
##Media Queries and Width

The most common way to use media queries is by targeting the width of a device.

The previous example had a `max-width` declared meaning that any styles in that media query will only apply to a screen that is equal to or smaller than the max-width. You can also use `min-width` to target screen sizes that are equal to or *larger* than the min-width.  This is useful when using a mobile-first approach to designing.

```css
@media (min-width: 400px) {
  ...
}
```

You can also specify a range by combining min-width and max-width. This will only be applied when the width of your browser is greater or equal to 768px and less or equal to 940px.

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 940px) { 
    ...     
}
```
    </script></section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
##Media Queries and Heights

Heights can be targeting in the same way as widths are using min-height or max-height.

```css
@media (min-height: 568px) {
    /* anything as high or higher than the iPhone 5 */
}
```

You can also mix height and width in the same media query:

```css
@media (min-height: 568px) and (min-width:320px) {
    ...
}
```

**Note**: Height-based media queries can be tricky. For example, browser bars may take up different heights and most of the time, you want your content to just flow as long as it needs to be. 
    </script></section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
##Class Exercise: Media Queries!

Let's add our first media query!  Adding a noticeable change like a background colour into each media query can help us to see easily where our breakpoints are, like this:

```css
@media (max-width: 1000px) {

  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }  
}
```

In today's project, we have an image set as the background so in this specific instance, this trick might not be as easy to see.  Let's try changing the font colour instead.

```css
@media (max-width: 1000px) {

  body {
    color: lightblue;
  }  
}
```

Where to add the media queries? Personal preference.
Some people like to create a separate style sheet just for media queries, others like to group it with the CSS section it's being applied to (e.g. responsive header changes are added directly under the base header styles).

For today, let's just group all of our media queries at the bottom of the style sheet.
    </script></section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
##Common breakpoints

There are many different device sizes so trying to target a specific device is tricky.  It's best to combine fluid techniques *with* media queries so the design is still flexible in between common breakpoints. Here are some to consider:

320px — Mobile portrait  
480px — Mobile landscape  
600px — Small tablet  
768px — Tablet portrait  
940px - 1024px — Tablet landscape, small desktop  
1280px & greater — Desktop  

These are just general guidelines. Add media queries to optimize for desktop/laptops, tablets and mobile phones. Use fluid techniques wherever possible, then add a breakpoint when the design breaks and is no longer suitable that viewport.

On the other hand, be careful about using too many breakpoints. If you find that you have two media queries that are close, see if you can move the styles to one or the other instead of creating another breakpoint.

##Exercise (15 mins)

Using the general breakpoint guidelines and the first media query example, add two more media queries to target tablet and mobile.  

Don't forget to test it!

(See the next slide for the answer but only if you're really stuck!)

**Bonus exercise**:    
Change your accent colour! Using Chrome's dev tools, *inspect* any element that has a colour, try the "Hello" background or a link, to see if you can figure out where the blue CSS color is coming from and change it to your own colour choice.

##Don't Forget the Viewport Meta Tag!

The viewport meta tag **must** be included in the <head> of your HTML document to ensure that the page responds on mobile devices. This tag tells browsers (primarily mobile browsers) how to size itself.

```xml
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

* `meta` is the tag name and goes in the `<head` of the web page.
* `name="viewport"` use viewport to tell the browser sizing information.
* `content` provides info about how to size the viewport. Multiple `key=value` are comma separated.
* `width=device-width` tells the browser to be as wide as the device.
* `initial-scale` is the zoom value at which the site is zoomed in/out by default. A value of 1.0 will render the size without any zoom.
* `user-scalable=no` (not shown in example), will limit users from being able to zoom into your website.
* `minimum-scale` & `maximum-scale` will limit how far in or out a user can scale/zoom into the website.

In the Chrome emulator, see how the layout changes once the viewport meta tag is added.

##Class Exercise

Let's figure out what we need to change to get it to look like this:

![](http://cl.ly/image/03403z392120/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-30%20at%2012.33.31%20AM.png)

1. What breakpoint should we make this change at?
1. Move the image to the right side.
1. Adjust the width of the image and content area.

This means we have to override the current CSS.  To override it, we need to use the same selector or a more specific selector.  Using the Chrome dev tools will make it easier to figure out rather than just looking at the CSS files.  Let's open it now, look for the selectors to target and test out some CSS changes.
    </script></section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
##Exercise (15mins) - Updating the About section

After looking through the dev tools, we've determine where and what changes to make.  

1. Breakpoint should be around 768px - 900px-ish (You decide what looks good.)
1. The classes that should be targeted are `.profile-image` and `.profile .summary`
1. For `.profile-image`, these are the values that need to change:
```
float: left;
width: 27%;
margin-right: 3%;
```
  * adjust these values to make it float to the right as well as increase the profile image width.
1. For `.profile .summary`, these are the values that need to change:
```
float: left;
width: 70%;
```
  * adjust these values to reflect the width changes in the profile image and remove the float so the text wraps the image.

Hints: 

* Make sure your width percentages equals 100%, including margin!
* Since you can't delete CSS with media queries, use the value of `none` to reset a float.

(A sample answer is on the next slide.)
    </script></section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown><script type="text/template">

      The **Work Experience** section looks fine at this breakpoint but once we start going smaller, it starts to get squished.  So let's go back to the Chrome dev tools and see what to adjust here.

      Perhaps changing it from two columns, side by side, to stacking the content on top of each other will do the trick.  Let's check it out!

##Exercise (15mins) - Updating Work Experience 

After looking at the Work Experience section, we've determined where the changes need to be made. The below snippet is the base CSS.  To get rid of the floated two columns styles, reset the float (hint: use `none`), adjust the width to span all the way across and remove/update any padding & margin to your liking.

```css
.work-experience .details {
  float: left;
  width: 30%;
  padding-right: 30px;
}
.work-experience .description {
  font-size: 14px;
  width: 70%;
  float: right;
  margin-top: 5px;
}
```
**Pro tip!** Only use the properties that need to be changed.  For example, if the font-size doesn't need to be change, no need to add it to the media query.

      <p><strong>Margin, padding, line-height, text-size, and font-family.</strong></p>
      <p>These are all extremely important in responsive design - keep your text limited and meaningful, use one to two readable fonts, and make sure text is a good size for all screen sizes.</p>
      <p>Typography on a responsive site should be: easy to read, efficient and responsive itself. How do we accomplish this?</p>

      <h2>Responsive Type: Rems and Ems Versus Pixels</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="delayed"><strong>px:</strong> pixels, fixed size, not responsive. Boo.</li>
        <li class="delayed"><strong>em:</strong> size is relative to the type size of the parent element. Eg. if parent element is 14px and child element is 1em, child element is 14px. If child element is 0.5em child element is 7px</li>
        <li class="delayed"><strong>rem:</strong> root ems - like ems but relative ONLY to the root element (html element) - not supported in older browsers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="delayed">This can be very confusing. Here's a great way to approach it: <a href="http://css-tricks.com/rems-ems/" alt="css tricks rems versus ems article">http://css-tricks.com/rems-ems</a></p>
      <p class="delayed">When in doubt, use rems, and set a base font-size on your html element. The default is equivalent to 16px, but you can set it to anything you want.</p>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
##Making font sizes responsive

How do we calculate rems?  If you want the font-size to be equivalent to 80px, then divide it by the base font-size to get the rem value.

80 / 16 = 5rem

If you want simpler math, set your base font-size to either 62.5% or 10px.

Now, 1rem = 10px, 1.1rem = 11px, 2.4rem = 24px, etc.

Let's update just the font-size for h1 and h2 to rems.

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%; /* sets base font size to be equal to 10px */
}
h1 {
  font-family: "Pacifico", cursive;
  font-size: 8rem; /* 80px */
  font-weight: 400;
  margin: 0;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 3.2rem; /* 32px */
}
```

**Pro tip!** Using percent-based & relative measurements can give you finer control because you can use decimals with pixels.

##How does this make it responsive?

Let's go back to the browser and look our header text. When we hit our 600px breakpoint, we can make the text smaller to fit the viewport better.  Pixels are fixed units, so to make this change we would have to override both heading values.  Something like this:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 80px;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 32px;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 60px;
  }
  h2 {
    font-size: 22px;
  }
}
```

With relative units, we can just adjust the base font size.  Any fonts declared in pixels will not be affected by this change.  That can be useful for when you want the size to always remain fixed.

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
h1 {
  font-size: 8rem;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 3.2rem;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  html {
    font-size: 40%;
  }
}
```

Let's add this update and see how it affects our page.

##rem & px

In the previous example, changing the root font size (`html`) made all of the relative units size accordingly, but you can still use pixels for the styles that need to be at a fixed size and not relative.  For example, you may just want your headings to get smaller but the paragraphs remain the same.

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
h1 {
  font-size: 8rem;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 3.2rem;
}
p {
  font-size: 16px; /* will not change sizes */
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  html {
    font-size: 40%;
  }
}
```

##Hiding Elements
Here's how to do it, but don't make this a habit. It's convenient but the browser still needs to load this code, and that slows your site down. Use it sparingly!

```css
@media (max-width: somewidthpx) {
  selector {
    display: none;
  }
}
```
That's it!

      <h2>Final Notes</h2>
      <p>Responsive is an iterative process. Don't get discouraged if every time you look back at your site, something needs to be changed! Websites are never "done", even the best can always be improved.</p>
      <p>When in doubt:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid fixed elements, hover effects, etc. as necessary parts of the functionality of your site</li>
        <li>Think about <strong>HOW</strong> your user will be using your site: mobile's different!</li>
        <li>Keep it simple! Less words, utilize white space</li>
        <li>Remember your site will never look pixel perfect on 100% of viewport sizes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Take a look at <strong>final.html</strong> & <strong>final.css</strong> to get some more ideas!</p>
